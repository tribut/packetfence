#
#	Sample configuration file for dynamically updating the list
#	of RADIUS clients at run time.
#
#	Everything is keyed off of a client "network".  (e.g. 192.168/16)
#	This configuration lets the server know that clients within
#	that network are defined dynamically.
#
#	When the server receives a packet from an unknown IP address
#	within that network, it tries to find a dynamic definition
#	for that client.  If the definition is found, the IP address
#	(and other configuration) is added to the server's internal
#	cache of "known clients", with a configurable lifetime.
#
#	Further packets from that IP address result in the client
#	definition being found in the cache.  Once the lifetime is
#	reached, the client definition is deleted, and any new requests
#	from that client are looked up as above.
#
#	If the dynamic definition is not found, then the request is
#	treated as if it came from an unknown client.  i.e. It is
#	silently discarded.
#
#	As part of protection from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,
#	the server will add only one new client per second.  This CANNOT
#	be changed, and is NOT configurable.

		#  Put any modules you want here.  SQL, LDAP, "exec",
		#  Perl, etc.  The only requirements is that the
		#  attributes MUST go into the control item list.
		#
		#  The request that is processed through this section
		#  is EMPTY.  There are NO attributes.  The request is fake,
		#  and is NOT the packet that triggered the lookup of
		#  the dynamic client.
		#
		#  The ONLY piece of useful information is either
		#
		#	Packet-Src-IP-Address (IPv4 clients)
		#	Packet-Src-IPv6-Address (IPv6 clients)
		#
		#  The attributes used to define a dynamic client mirror
		#  the configuration items in the "client" structure.
		#

		#
		#  Example 1: Hard-code a client IP.  This example is
		#             useless, but it documents the attributes
		#             you need.
		#
		#
		#  Example 2: Read the clients from "clients" files
		#             in a directory.
		#

		#             This requires you to uncomment the
		#             "directory" configuration in the
		#             "client dynamic" configuration above,
		#	      and then put one file per IP address in
		#             that directory.

		#
		#  Example 3: Look the clients up in SQL.
		#
		#  This requires the SQL module to be configured, of course.
