=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item CLI deauthentication

De-authentication of a Wireless user is based on CLI access (Telnet or SSH).
This is a vendor issue and it might be fixed in newer firmware versions.

=item Per SSID VLAN Assignment on unencrypted network not supported

The vendor doesn't include the SSID in their RADIUS-Request when on MAC Authentication.
VLAN assignment per SSID is not possible.
This is a vendor issue and might be fixed in newer firmware versions.

=item Caching problems on secure connections

Performing a de-authentication does not clear the key cache. 
Meaning that on reconnection the device's authorization is served straight from the cache 
instead of creating a new RADIUS query.
This defeats the reason why we perform de-authentication (to change VLAN or deny access).

A client-side workaround exists: disable the PMK Caching on the client.
However this could (and should in our opinion) be fixed by the vendor.

We made some progress about this lately.  In fact, for the 4.0 version tree, you need 
to get version 4.0-160 in order to disable the PMK caching at the AP level.  For the
5.0 version tree, all versions including 5.0-87 are impacted.  Vendor is saying that
in the 5.1 version, PMK will be disabled by default.  To be confirmed.

=item Be careful with Roles access control support (Meru's firewall rules)

Once written these are enforced automatically on the controller's primary 
ethernet interface.

=item deauthenticateMacDefault

Right now te only way to do it is from the CLi (through Telnet or SSH).

Warning: this code doesn't support elevating to privileged mode. See #900 and #1370.

Return the reference to the deauth technique or the default deauth technique.
