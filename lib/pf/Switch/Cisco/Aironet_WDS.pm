package pf::Switch::Cisco::Aironet_WDS;
=head1 NAME

pf::Switch::Cisco::Aironet_WDS - Object oriented module to parse SNMP traps
and manage Cisco Aironet configured in Wireless Domain Services (WDS) mode.

=head1 STATUS

This module implements some changes on top of L<pf::Switch::Cisco::WLC>.
You should also consult the documentation over there if you experience issues.

=item Supports

Deauthentication with RADIUS Disconnect (RFC3576)

=back

Tested on an Aironet WDS on IOS 12.3.8JEC3

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item deauthentication requires SSH access

Even though we perform the deauthentication with RFC3576 through Packet of
Disconnect (PoD). SSH access is still required.

Due to a Cisco issue, deauthentication attempts made directly to the
WDS node, even though accepted, do not fully deauthenticate the client. It
feels like the crypto caches aren't properly invalidated which cause
subsequent re-association from the client never to trigger AAA.

As a work-around, we connect to the WDS to obtain the current Access-Point
where the MAC is located (with SSH) and then issue a PoD directly to the AP.

Several improvements could be made by Cisco regarding this issue so a close
look at their next IOS releases notes is in order.
