pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_3750G

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object oriented module to access and configure Cisco Catalyst 3750G switches

This module implements a few things but for the most part refer to L<pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_2960>.

=head1 STATUS

Should work in:

=over

=item port-security

=item MAC-Authentication / 802.1X

We've got reports of it working with 12.2(55)SE.
Stacked switches should also work.

=back

The minimum required firmware version is 12.2(25)SEE2.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item NasPortToIfIndex

Translate RADIUS NAS-Port into switch's ifIndex.

=cut

sub NasPortToIfIndex {
    my ($this, $NAS_port) = @_;
    my $logger = Log::Log4perl::get_logger(ref($this));

    # NAS-Port bumps by +100 between stacks while ifIndex bumps by +500
    # some examples values for stacked switches are available in t/network-devices/cisco.t
    # This could work with other Cisco switches but we couldn't test so we implemented it only for the 3750.
    if (my ($stack_idx, $port) = $NAS_port =~ /^50(\d)(\d\d)$/) {
        return ( ($stack_idx - 1) * $CISCO::IFINDEX_PER_STACK ) + $port + $CISCO::IFINDEX_GIG_OFFSET;
    } else {
        $logger->warn("Unknown NAS-Port format. ifIndex translation could have failed. "
            ."VLAN re-assignment and switch/port accounting will be affected.");
    }
    return $NAS_port;
