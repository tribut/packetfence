=head1 NAME

pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_3550 - Object oriented module to access and configure Cisco Catalyst 3550 switches

=head1 STATUS

This module is currently only a placeholder, see pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_2960.

IOS 12.2(44)SE6 is known to work.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Because a lot of code is shared with the 2960 make sure to check the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section of 
L<pf::Switch::Cisco::Catalyst_2960> also.

=item Port-Security + Voice over IP (VoIP): IOS 12.2(25r) disappearing config

For some reason when securing a MAC address the switch loses an important portion of its config.
This is a Cisco bug, nothing much we can do. Don't use this IOS for VoIP.
See issue #1020 for details.

=item Port-Security problematic firmwares

Known issues with IOS 12.2(35)SE5

=item ifIndex inconsistencies

IfIndex on this platform is not the same as port # or dot1d port.

=item NasPortToIfIndex

Translate RADIUS NAS-Port into switch's ifIndex.
This switch's NAS-Port behavior is different than the 2960.

We considered changing the dependency chain to the 2950 but we think we 
have less chances of breaking things if we just do the proper translation 
here because we would have heard if port-security was broken anyway. That 
said, if you hear about MAC-Auth / 802.1x regressions consider making this 
method do per-IOS translations.

            ."VLAN re-assignment and switch/port accounting will be affected.");
