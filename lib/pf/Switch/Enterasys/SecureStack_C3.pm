=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item Multiple untagged egress VLAN per port

This switch supports multiple untagged VLAN per port but personally I don't think it's a "feature" ;). 
What happens is since we only change the primary VLAN id (PVID) on a setVlan, you need to pre-approve all the 
possible VLANs as untagged VLANs on the user ports. 
This way when the PVID changes, the VLAN was already authorized to go out egress untagged.

For example, if your normal VLAN is 10, isolation is 9 and registration is 8 and your users ports are 1 to 23 then you run:

set vlan egress 8,9,10 ge.1.1-ge.1.23 untagged

and you will be fine.

=item SNMPv3
    
SNMPv3 support was not tested
