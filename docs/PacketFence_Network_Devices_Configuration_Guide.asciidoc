About this Guide
----------------

This guide covers the configuration of network devices in order to integrate 
them with PacketFence in VLAN enforcement. Switches, wireless controllers and 
wireless access points are all considered network devices in PacketFence's 
terms.

The latest version of this guide is available at http://www.packetfence.org/documentation/

Note on Inline enforcement support
----------------------------------

There is no need to follow the instructions in this guide if you plan on deploying in inline 
enforcement, except radius inline. In this case all you need to do is to have a flat layer 2 network up to 
PacketFence's inline interface with no other gateway available for devices to reach out to the 
Internet. 

This technique is usually used when your network hardware doesn't support VLAN 
enforcement. 

List of supported Network Devices

3COM
~~~~

SuperStack 3 Switch 4200 and 4500
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports these 3Com switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type:

* linkUp/linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

Don't forget to update the startup config!

linkUp / linkDown only
++++++++++++++++++++++

Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable standard linkup linkdown

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4

In Port Security
++++++++++++++++

Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable
  port-security enable
  port-security trap addresslearned
  port-security trap intrusion

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4
  port-security max-mac-count 1
  port-security port-mode secure
  port-security intrusion-mode blockmac
  undo enable snmp trap updown

E4800G
^^^^^^

PacketFence supports these 3Com switches with the following techniques:

* 802.1X with MAC Authentication fallback
* linkUp/linkDown (not recommended)

Voice over IP support was not explicitly tested during implementation however 
it does not mean that it won't work. 

Don't forget to update the startup config!

linkUp / linkDown only
++++++++++++++++++++++

Global config settings:

  snmp-agent
  snmp-agent target-host trap address udp-domain 192.168.1.5 params securityname public
  snmp-agent trap enable standard linkup linkdown

On each interface:

  port access vlan 4

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Global config settings:

       quit 
     domain default enable packetfence.local 
     dot1x authentication-method eap 
     port-security enable 
  quit 

If your management authentication on your switch is default, applying the 
configuration above will have your authentication switch to a RADIUS based one
with PacketFence as the authentication server. *It is almost certain that you 
do not want that!*

Below, we will just create a local password for `vty` accesses (telnet) and 
nothing on the console. *In order to avoid locking yourself out, make sure 
to verify your configuration!*

  system-view 
     user-interface aux 0 
       authentication-mode none 
    user-interface vty 0 4 
      user privilege level 3 
      set authentication password simple useStrongerPassword 
    quit 
  quit 

On each interface:

  system-view 
    interface gigabitEthernet 1/0/xx 
      port-security port-mode mac-else-userlogin-secure-ext 
      # userlogin-secure-or-mac-ext could be used below instead 
      # see the Switch_4200G's documentation for a discussion about it

NJ220 
^^^^^

This switch does not support port-security. 

To configure: use web interface to send the linkUp/linkDown traps to the PacketFence server. 

AlliedTelesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AT8000GS
^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports the AT8000GS switch using :

* Mac Authentication (mac-only)
* 802.1X

VoIP support is limited using 802.1X/MAC authentication.  We do have a limitation where the phone needs to be on the same VLAN as the PC (no voice VLAN concept).

Mac Authentication
++++++++++++++++++

First, activate 802.1X globally:

   dot1x system-auth-control

Next, configure the RADIUS server and AAA settings:

   radius-server host 10.0.0.100               
   radius-server key qwerty
   radius-server source-ip 10.0.0.14
   aaa authentication dot1x default radius 
   aaa accounting dot1x radius

In order to get mac authentication, you need to enable the guest VLAN globally: 

   interface vlan 5
   name "Guest Vlan"
   dot1x guest-vlan
   exit

Finally, enable the necessary 802.1X settings for mac-only authentication:

   interface ethernet g1
   dot1x mac-authentication mac-only
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan                
   dot1x port-control auto
   dot1x guest-vlan enable


802.1X
++++++

The settings are almost the same as the MAC Authentication with some small differences.

First, activate 802.1X globally:

   dot1x system-auth-control

Next, configure the RADIUS server and AAA settings:

   radius-server host 10.0.0.100
   radius-server key qwerty
   radius-server source-ip 10.0.0.14
   aaa authentication dot1x default radius
   aaa accounting dot1x radius

Finally, enable the necessary 802.1X settings:

   interface ethernet g1    
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan
   dot1x port-control auto

Amer 
~~~~

PacketFence supports Amer switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type: 

* linkUp/linkDown 

Don't forget to update the startup config! 

L2 Switch SS2R24i 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Global config settings:

  create snmp host 192.168.1.5 v2c public 
  create snmp user public ReadGroup 
  enable snmp traps 

On each interface: 

  config vlan default delete xx 
  config vlan mac-detection add untagged xx 

where `xx` stands for the interface index 

Avaya 
~~~~~

Avaya bought Nortel's wired networks assets. So Avaya switches are, in effect, re-branded 
Nortels. See <<_nortel,Nortel section>> of this document for configuration instructions. 

Brocade
~~~~~~~

ICX 6400 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Those switches are supported using 802.1X for networks with or without VoIP.

* Global config settings:

  aaa authentication dot1x default radius
  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 default
  radius-server key useStrongerSecret

  vlan 1 name DEFAULT-VLAN by port
  !
  vlan 100 by port
   tagged ethe 1/1/xx ethe 1/1/yy

Where `xx` and `yy` represent the range of ports where you want PacketFence
enforcement.

MAC-Authentication without VoIP
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Enable MAC-Authentication globally

  mac-authentication enable
  mac-authentication mac-vlan-dyn-activation

* Enable MAC-Authentication on each interface you want PacketFence active

   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan

MAC-Authentication with VoIP
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Enable cdp globally

  cdp run

* Apply the following configuration on each interface you want PacketFence active

   dual-mode
   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan
   voice-vlan 100
   cdp enable

802.1x/MAC-Auth
+++++++++++++++

* Enable 802.1X globally

  dot1x-enable
   re-authentication
   enable ethe 1/1/xx

Where `xx` is the switch port number

* Apply the following configuration on each interface you want PacketFence active

   dot1x port-control auto
   dual-mode
   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan
   voice-vlan 100


Cisco
~~~~~

PacketFence supports Cisco switches with VoIP using three different trap types: 

* linkUp/linkDown 
* MAC Notification 
* Port Security (with static MACs) 

On some recent models, we can also use more secure and robust features like: 

* MAC Authentication (Cisco's MAC Authentication Bypass or MAB) 
* 802.1x (Multi-Host or Multi-Domain) 

Depending of the switch model, we recommend the use of the most secure and reliable feature 
first. In other words, you should consider the following order:

. 802.1x/MAB 
. Port-Security 
. linkUp/linkDown 

2900XL Series and 3500XL Series 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

linkUP/linkDown SNMP traps 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Global config settings: 

  snmp-server community public RO

Those switches are now supported using 802.1X for networks with or without VoIP. 
You can also use port-security with static MAC address but we can not secure 
a MAC on the data VLAN specifically so enable it if there is no VoIP, use 
linkUp/linkDown and MAC notification otherwise.So on setup that needs to 
handle VoIP with this switch, go with a 802.1X configuration. 

802.1X

Recently, we were able to add the support for 802.1X on those switch even if 
they are not supporting RADIUS dynamic VLAN assignments.

Port-Security 
+++++++++++++

CAUTION: With port-security, if no MAC is connected on ports when activating port-security, we need 
to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new 
MAC appears on a port. On the other hand, if a MAC is actually connected when you enable 
port security, you must secure this MAC rather than the bogus one. Otherwise this MAC will 
lose its connectivity instantly.

Since version PacketFence 2.2.1, the way to handle VoIP when using 
port-security dramatically changed. Ensure that you follow the instructions 
below. To make the story short, instead on relying on the dynamic 
MAC learning for VoIP, we use a static entry on the voice VLAN so we can trigger a new security 
violation, and then authorize the phone MAC address on the network.

anything about the router interfaces (ie: fa0 and fa1 on a 1811). VLAN interfaces `ifIndex` should

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable MAC locking 
only. Also, by default this switch doesn't do an electrical low-level linkDown when setting the 
port to admin down. So we need to activate a global option called `forcelinkdown` to enable 
this behaviour. Without this option, clients don't understand that they lost their connection and 
they never do a new DHCP on VLAN change.

below.

CAUTION: This switch Switch accepts multiple untagged VLAN per port when configured 
through SNMP. This is problematic because on some occasions the untagged VLAN port list 
can become inconsistent with the switch’s running config. To fix that, clear all untagged VLANs 
of a port even if the CLI interface doesn’t show them. 
To do so, use: `clear vlan egress <vlans> <ports>`

HP
~~

E4800G and E5500G Switch series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are re-branded 3Com switches, see under the <<_3com,3Com section>> for their documentation.

HP ProCurve
~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports ProCurve switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types:

* linkUp/linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

*We recommend to enable Port Security only.*

Don't forget to update the startup config!

NOTE: HP ProCurve only sends one security trap to PacketFence per security violation so make sure PacketFence runs when you configure port-security. Also, because of the above limitation, it is considered good practice to reset the intrusion flag as a first troubleshooting step.

If you want to learn more about intrusion flag and port-security, please refer to the ProCurve documentation.

CAUTION: If you configure a switch that is already in production be careful that enabling port-security causes active MAC addresses to be automatically added to the intrusion list without a security trap sent to PacketFence. This is undesired because PacketFence will not be notified that it needs to configure the port. As a work-around, unplug clients before activating port-security or remove the intrusion flag after you enabled port-security with: `port-security <port> clear-intrusion-flag`.

2500 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable Port Security only.

On 2500's, we need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port.

Global config settings:

  snmp-server community "public" Unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

On each interface: 

  port-security xx learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 0200000000xx

where `xx` stands for the interface index

2600 Series and 3400cl Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable Port Security only.

On 2600's, we *don't* need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public manager unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

On each interface: 

  port-security xx learn-mode configured action send-alarm

where `xx` stands for the interface index

MAC Authentication (Firmware > 11.72)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to enable RADIUS mac authentication on the ports, you first need to join the ports to either the registration or the mac detection vlan (as a security measure).

Next, define the RADIUS server host:

   radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key use_stong_secret

Since HP now supports server-group, let's create a group for the MAC authentication.  Another one can be used for management access:

   aaa server-group radius "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5
   aaa server-group radius "management" host 10.0.0.15

Configure the AAA authentication for MAC authentication to use the proper server-group:

   aaa authentication mac-based chap-radius server-group "packetfence"

Finally, enable MAC authentication on all necessary ports:

   aaa port-access mac-based 1-24

Don't forget to permit address moves and the reauth period.  x represents the port index:

   aaa port-access mac-based x addr-moves
   aaa port-access mac-based x reauth-period 14400
   
(Thanks to Jean-Francois Laporte for this contribution)

4100, 5300, 5400 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default and we have not found a way yet to disable them so do not forget to declare the trunk ports as uplinks in the switch config file.

On 4100's, we need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port. The ports are indexed differently on 4100's: it's based on the number of modules you have in your 4100, each module is indexed with a letter.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community "public" Unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

You should configure interfaces like this:

  port-security A1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000001
  ...
  port-security A24 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000024
  port-security B1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000025
  ...
  port-security B24 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000048
  port-security C1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000049
  ...

MAC Authentication (with VoIP)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to have MAC Authentication working with VoIP, you need to ensure that the Voice VLAN is tagged on all the port first. You also need to activate lldp notification on all ports that will handle VoIP. 
*Finally, make sure to change the value of the $VOICEVLANAME variable in the Procurve 5400 module's source code.*

RADIUS configuration

  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key strongKey

MAC Authentication

  aaa port-access mac-based C5-C7
  aaa port-access mac-based C5 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access mac-based C6 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access mac-based C7 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access C5 controlled-direction in
  aaa port-access C6 controlled-direction in
  aaa port-access C7 controlled-direction in

802.1X (with VoIP)
++++++++++++++++++

Same as MAC Authentication, you need to ensure that the Voice VLAN is tagged on all the port first if using 802.1X. You also need to activate lldp notification on all ports that will handle VoIP. 
*Finally, make sure to change the value of the $VOICEVLANAME variable in the Procurve 5400 module's source code.*

RADIUS configuration

  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key strongKey

802.1X

  aaa authentication port-access eap-radius
  aaa port-access authenticator C3-C4
  aaa port-access authenticator C3 client-limit 3
  aaa port-access authenticator C4 client-limit 3
  aaa port-access authenticator active

~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports iPECS series switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types:

* linkUp / linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

On some recent models, we can also use more secure and robust features, like:

* MAC Authentication
* 802.1x

ES-4500G Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LinkUp / LinkDown
+++++++++++++++++

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for linkUp / linkDown

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

Firmware is kinda buggy so you'll need to enable linkUp / linkDown using the Web Interface under *Administration -> SNMP*.

Some reports shows that the switch doesn't always send linkDown traps.

On each interface (except uplink)

  switchport allowed vlan add 4 untagged
  switchport native vlan 4
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for port-security.

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

On each interface (except uplink)

  port security max-mac-count 1
  port security
  port security action trap
  switchport allowed vlan add 2 untagged
  switchport native vlan 2
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

The above _port security_ command may not work using the CLI. In this case, use the Web Interface under the *Security -> Port Security* menu and enable each ports using the checkboxes.

It is also recommended, when using port-security, to disable link-change (UP / DOWN) traps.

Don't forget to update the startup config!

Linksys
~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports Linksys switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type:

* linkUp/linkDown

Don't forget to update the startup config!

SRW224G4
^^^^^^^^

Global config settings

  no snmp-server trap authentication
  snmp-server community CS_2000_le rw view Default 
  snmp-server community CS_2000_ls ro view Default 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public 2

On each interface

  switchport access vlan 4

Netgear
~~~~~~~

The "web-managed smart switch" models GS108Tv2/GS110/GS110TP are supported with Link up/down traps only.

Higher-end "fully managed" switches including FSM726v1 are supported in Port Security mode.

FSM726 / FSM726S version 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports FSM726 / FSM726S version 1 switches _without VoIP_ in Port Security mode (with static MACs) – called Trusted MAC table on Netgear's hardware.

Using the HTTP GUI, follow the steps below to configure such feature. Of course, you must create all your VLANs on the switch as well.

[float]
SNMP Settings
+++++++++++++

In *Advanced -> SNMP -> Community Table*, create a read-write community string and a trap community string. You can use the same community for all the 3 functions (Get, Set, Trap).
  
Next, under *Advanced -> SNMP -> Host Table*, enable the Host Authorization feature and add the PacketFence server into the allowed host list.

Finally, under *Advanced -> SNMP -> Trap Setting*, enable the authentication trap.

[float]
Trusted MAC Security
++++++++++++++++++++

Under *Advanced -> Advanced Security -> Trusted MAC Address*, create a fake MAC address per port (ie. 02:00:00:00:00:xx where `xx` is the port number). This will have the effect of sending a security trap to PacketFence when a new device plugs on the port.
  
Don't forget to save the configuration!

GS108Tv2 / GS110T / GS110TP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports certain lower-end Netgear switches in Link Up/Link Down traps. These "web-managed" switches have no command-line interface and only a subset of the port security and 802.1X functionnality needed to interoperate with PacketFence in these more advanced modes. There is no way to send a trap upon port security violation, and there is only pure 802.1X, no MAC Address Bypass.

[float]
Switch Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

It can be difficult to find the advanced features in the web GUI. We recommend using the GUI "Maintenance" tab to Upload the configuration to a file, and then edit it there.

Hints on file upload/download:

From the File Type menu, choose Text Configuration.

If you're uploading to the TFTP root directory, leave Path blank.

At the top of the config file, you need:

  vlan database
  vlan 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan name 1 "Normal"
  vlan name 2 "Registration"
  vlan name 3 "Isolation"
  vlan name 4 "MAC Detection"
  vlan name 5 "Guest"
  exit

In the same section as "users passwd", you need to specify your PacketFence server's management address:

  snmptrap useStrongerSecret ipaddr 192.168.1.5

In the same section as the "voip oui" lines, you need to allow your SNMP server:

  snmp-server community "public"
  snmp-server community rw useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 public
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 public
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 useStrongerSecret
  no voip vlan

You should use port 1 as the uplink. If you connect port 1 of a GS108Tv2 switch into a Power over Ethernet switch, then the GS108Tv2 does not need AC power. If you bought GS110T(P) switches, presumably it's for the SFP uplink option. You'll want to configure both port 1 and the SFP ports 9-10 as trunks:

  interface 0/1
  no snmp trap link-status
  ip dhcp filtering trust
  vlan pvid 1
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan tagging 2,3,4,5
  no auto-voip
  exit

Each user-facing, PacketFence-managed port should be configured like:

  interface 0/2
  vlan pvid 4
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 4
  no auto-voip
  exit

Nortel
~~~~~~

PacketFence supports Nortel switches with VoIP using one trap type:

* Mac Security

Don't forget to update the startup config!

NOTE: if you are using a 5500 series with a firmware version of 6 or above, you must use a different module called Nortel::BayStack5500_6x in your `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`. Indeed, Nortel introduced an incompatible change of behavior in this firmware.

Wireless Controllers and Access Point Configuration
---------------------------------------------------

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout this configuration example we use the following assumptions for our network infrastructure:

[options="compact"]
* PacketFence is fully configured with FreeRADIUS running
* PacketFence IP address: 192.168.1.5
* Normal VLAN: 1
* Registration VLAN: 2
* Isolation VLAN: 3
* MAC Detection VLAN: 4
* Guest VLAN: 5
* VoIP, Voice VLAN: 100
* use SNMP v2c
* SNMP community name: public
* RADIUS Secret: useStrongerSecret footnote:[Be careful to change the secret key to a much stronger one. A 16 character random secret with digits, upper case and lower case characters is recommended.]
* Open SSID: PacketFence-Public
* WPA-Enterprise SSID: PacketFence-Secure


Unsupported Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wireless network access configuration is a lot more consistent between vendors. This is due to the fact that the situation is a lot more standardized than the wired side: VLAN assignment is done centrally with RADIUS and that the client protocol is consistent (MAC-Authentication or 802.1X).

This consistency has the benefit that a lot of the wireless network devices tend to work out-of-the-box with PacketFence. The only missing piece being, in most cases, remote deauthentication of the client which is used for VLAN assignment (deauth user so it'll reconnect and get new VLAN).

So, even if your wireless equipment is not explicitly supported by PacketFence, it's recommended that you give it a try. The next section covers the objectives that you want to accomplish for trying out your equipment even if we don't have configuration for it.

Here are the high-level requirements for proper wireless integration with PacketFence

* The appropriate VLANs must exist
* Allow controller to honor VLAN assignments from AAA (sometimes called AAA override)
* Put your open SSID (if any) in MAC-Authentication mode and authenticate against the FreeRADIUS hosted on PacketFence
* Put your secure SSID (if any) in 802.1X mode and authenticate against FreeRADIUS hosted on PacketFence.
* On registration / isolation VLANs the DHCP traffic must reach the PacketFence server
* On your production VLANs a copy of the DHCP traffic must reach PacketFence where a pfdhcplistener listens (configurable in `pf.conf` under `interfaces`)

At this point, user registration with the captive-portal is possible and registered users should have access to the appropriate VLANs. However, VLAN changes (like after a registration) won't automatically happen, you will need to disconnect / reconnect. An explanation is provided in introduction section above about this behavior.

You can try modules similar to your equipment if any (read appropriate instructions) or you can try to see if RFC3576 is supported. RFC3576 covers RADIUS Packet of Disconnect (PoD) also known as Disconnect Messages (DM) or Change of Authorization (CoA). You can try the Aruba module if you want to verify if RFC3576 is supported by your hardware.

If none of the above worked then you can fallback to inline enforcement or let us know what equipment you are using on the https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/packetfence-devel[packetfence-devel mailing list].

AeroHIVE
~~~~~~~~

AeroHIVE products are a bit different compared to the other vendors. They support either a local HiveManager (kind of wireless controller) or a cloud-based HVM. However, the configuration is the same for the local and the cloud-based controller. Note that all the config are made on the HVM and then pushed to the APs. 

[float]
AAA Client Settings
+++++++++++++++++++

In the HVM, go to *Configuration -> AAA Authentication -> AAA Client Settings*, and insert the proper properties:

* Give a RADIUS Name
* Add a RADIUS server with Authentication as the server type and primary as the role
* Make sure Permit Dynamic Change of Authorization is ticked (RFC 3576)

[float]
Public SSID
++++++++++++

Again in the HVM, go to *Configuration -> SSIDs*, and create a new SSID with the following:

* Give a Profile Name and an SSID Name
* Choose Open as the Access Security 
* Select Enable Mac Authentication
* Select your RADIUS server from the RADIUS Server dropdown list

[float]
Secure SSID
++++++++++++

In the HVM, go to *Configuration -> SSIDs*, and create a new SSID with the following :

* Give a Profile Name and an SSID Name
* Choose WPA2 Enterprise as the Access Security 
* Select WPA2-802.1X as the key management
* Select CCMP as the encryption method
* Select your RADIUS server from the RADIUS Server dropdown list

[float]
Roles (User Profiles)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support user profiles on the AeroHIVE hardware.  To build a User Profile, go to *Configuration -> User Profiles*, and create what you need.  When you define the switch
definition in PacketFence, the role will match the User Profile attribute number.  Example

   roles=CategoryStudent=1;CategoryStaff=2

And in the AeroHIVE configuration, you have :

   StudentProfile attribute number 1
   StaffProfile attribute number 2

Last step is to allow the User Profile to be returned for a particular SSID.  Go to *Configuration -> SSIDs -> Your_SSID -> User Profiles for Traffic Management*, and select the User Profiles you will
return for the devices.

NOTE: The VLAN ID is *NOT* returned by PacketFence if a role is available for a given category.   The VLAN ID needs to be configured in the User Profile definition on the AeroHIVE side.

[float]
Caching and Roaming
++++++++++++++++++++

AeroHIVE have a session replication feature to ease the EAP session roaming between two access points. However, this may cause problems when you bounce the wireless card of a client, it will not do a new RADIUS request. Two settings can be tweaked to reduce the caching impact, it is the roaming cache update interval and roaming cache ageout. They are located in *Configuration -> SSIDs -> [SSID Name] -> Optional Settings -> Advanced*.
The other way to support Roaming is to enable snmp trap in the AeroHIVE configuration to PacketFence server. PacketFence will recognise the ahConnectionChangeEvent and will change the location of the node in his base.

Aruba
~~~~~

All Aruba OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Aruba wireless controller for PacketFence via the web GUI. It was done on an Aruba Controller 200 software version ArubaOS 5.0.3.3, tested on a Controller 600 with ArubaOS 6.0 but it should apply to all Aruba models.

CAUTION: If you are already using your Aruba controllers and don't want to impact your users you should create new AAA profiles and apply them to new SSIDs instead of modifying the default ones.

NOTE: Starting with PacketFence 3.3, Aruba supports role-based access control. Read the Administration Guide under "Role-based enforcement support" for more information about how to configure it on the PacketFence side.

[float]
AAA Settings
+++++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> Authentication -> RADIUS Server* and add a RADIUS server named "packetfence" then edit it:

* Set Host to PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5)
* Set the Key to your RADIUS shared secret (useStrongerSecret)
* Click Apply

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> Server Group* add a new Server Group named "packetfence" then edit it to add your RADIUS Server "packetfence" to the group. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> RFC3576* add a new server with PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) and your RADIUS shared secret (useStrongerSecret). Click Apply.
Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> L2 Authentication* edit the MAC Authentication Profile called "default" then edit it to change the Delimiter to dash. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> L2 Authentication* edit the 802.1X Authentication Profile called "default" then edit it to uncheck the Opportunistic Key Caching under Advanced. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> AAA Profiles* click on the "default-mac-auth" profile then click on MAC Authentication Server Group and choose the "packetfence" server group. Click Apply. Move to the RFC3576 server sub item and choose PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) click add then apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> AAA Profiles* click on the "default-dot1x" profile then click on 802.1X Authentication Server Group and choose the "packetfence" server group. Click Apply. Move to the RFC3576 server sub item and choose PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) click add then apply.

[float]
Public SSID
++++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> AP Configuration* then edit the "default" AP Group. Go in *Wireless LAN -> Virtual AP* create a new profile with the following:

* AAA Profile: default-mac-auth
* SSID Profile: Select NEW then add an SSID (PacketFence-Public) and Network authentication set to None

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> AP Configuration* then edit the "default" AP Group. Go in *Wireless LAN -> Virtual AP* create a new profile with the following:

* AAA Profile: default-dot1x
* SSID Profile: Select NEW then add an SSID (PacketFence-Secure) and Network authentication set to WPA2

[float]
Roles
+++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles for the Aruba hardware.  To add roles, go in *Configuration -> Access Control -> User Roles -> Add*.  You don't need to force a VLAN usage in the Role
since we send also the VLAN ID along with the Aruba User Role in the RADIUS request.  Refer to the Aruba User Guide for more information about the Role creation.

WIPS
++++

In order to use the WIPS feature in PacketFence, please follow those simple steps to send the traps to PacketFence.

First, configure PacketFence to be a trap receiver.  Under *Configuration > SNMP > Trap Receivers*, add an entry for the PF management IP.  By default, all traps will be enabled.  If you want to disable some, you will need
to connect via CLI, and run the *snmp-server trap disable <trapname>* command.

Aruba Controller 200
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Aruba Controller 200 for PacketFence using the command line interface. We suggest you to use the instructions above for the Web GUI instead.

[float]
VLAN definition
+++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence VLANs, and our AccessPoint VLAN (VID 66). It is recommended to isolate the management of the thin APs in a separate VLAN.

Belair Networks (now Ericsson)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BE20
^^^^

The Belair Networks BE20s are fairly easy to configure.

Add VLANs
+++++++++

On the BE20 Web Interface, click on *Eth-1-1*.  By default, there will be nothing in there.  You need to first create an untagged VLAN (VLAN 0). In order to do that, you need to set
the PVID, Reverse PVID, and the VLAN field to 0.  Then click add.

Repeat that step for each of your VLANs by entering the proper VLAN ID in the VLAN field.
   
AAA Servers
+++++++++++

Once you have the VLANs setup, you need to add PacketFence into the AAA Server list.  Go to *System -> Radius Servers*.  Click on *Add server*, and fill out the proper information.

* Ensure the Enabled checkbox is selected
* IP Address: Insert the IP Address of the PacketFence Management Interface
* Shared Secret: Insert the shared secret for RADIUS communication

When done, click on the *Apply* button.

Secure SSID
+++++++++++
Since the BE20 doesn't support Open SSID with Mac Authentication, we will only describe how to configure a WPA2-Enterprise SSID.  First, we will configure the 5GHz antenna.

Click on *Wifi-1-1 -> Access SSID Config*.  From the *Configuration for SSID* dropdown, select the 1 entry.  Modify the fields like the following:

* SSID: Put your SSID Name you would like
* Type: Broadcast
* Use Privacy Mode: WPA2(AES) with EAP/DOT1x
* RADIUS NAS Identifier: You can put a string to identify your AP
* Radius Accounting Enabled: Checkbox Selected
* Radius Station ID Delimiter: dash
* Radius StationId Append Ssid: Checkbox Selected
* RADIUS Server 1: Select the AAA Server you created earlier

When done click *Apply*.  Repeat the same configuration for the 2.4GHz Antenna (Wifi-1-2).

That should conclude the configuration.  You can now save the configs to the flash by hitting the *Config Save* button on top of the Interface.

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WiSM for PacketFence using the web interface.

* First, globally define the FreeRADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's IP) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ is enabled (if not present it is enabled by default)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-radius-define.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Freeradius server"]

* Then we create two SSIDs:

** PacketFence-Public: non-secure with MAC authentication only
** PacketFence-Secure: secure with WPA2 Enterprise PEAP/MSCHAPv2

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-ssid-create.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID creation"]

* In the secure SSID, make sure 802.1X is enabled and select the appropriate encryption for your needs (recommended: WPA + WPA2)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l2-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L2 secure"]

* No layer 3 security

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l3-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L3 secure"]

* We set the IP of the FreeRADIUS server

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-secure-radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius secure"]

* VERY IMPORTANT: Allow AAA override (this allows VLAN assignment from RADIUS)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-secure-radius-advance.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius advanced secure"]

* Edit the non-secure SSID: Enable MAC authentication at level 2

EXSW Wireless Switches (Controllers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to have the Extricom controller working with PacketFence, you need to define two ESSID definition, one for the "public" network, and one for the "secure" network. This can be done under a very short time period since Extricom supports RADIUS assigned VLANs out of the box.

You first need to configure you RADIUS server. This is done under the: *WLAN Settings -> RADIUS* tab. Enter the PacketFence RADIUS server information. For the ESSID configuration. in the administration UI, go to *WLAN Settings -> ESSID definitions*. Create the profiles per the following:

[float]
Public SSID
+++++++++++

* MAC Authentication must be ticked
* Encryption method needs to be set to None
* Select PacketFence as the MAC Authentication RADIUS server (previously added)

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

* Encryption method needs to be set to WPA Enterprise/WPA2 Enterprise
* AES only needs to be selected
* Select PacketFence as the RADIUS server (previously added)

The final step is to enable SNMP Agent and SNMP Traps on the controller. This is done under the following tab in the administrative UI: *Advanced -> SNMP*.

Hostapd
~~~~~~~

OpenWRT
^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the OpenWRT access point (Hostapd software).
Hostapd must have been compiled with dynamic vlan support and you need to create a file /etc/config/hostapd.vlan that contain:

  *           wlan0.#

And you need to replace the /lib/wifi/hostapd.sh script file with the one included in /usr/local/pf/addons/hostapd

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Meru wireless controller for PacketFence via the web GUI.

[float]
Disable PMK Caching
+++++++++++++++++++

If you are running a WPA2 SSID, you may need to disable PMK caching in order to avoid deauthentication issues.  This is true if you are running AP 300s using any 5.0 versions including 5.0-87, or any versions below 4.0-160.

Here are the commands to run to disable the PMK caching at the AP level.  First, login the AP, and run this command to see which radios are broadcasting your SSID.
   vap display

Second, disable the PMK caching on those radios.
   radio pmkid radio00 disable

You can also add those commands to the AP bootscript.  Contact your Meru support representative for that part.

[float]
VLAN Definition
+++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence VLANs for client use. Go to *Configuration -> Wired -> VLAN*, and select Add.

* VLAN Name is the human readable name (ie. RegistrationVLAN)
* Tag is the VLAN ID
* Fast Ethernet Interface Index refers to the controller's ethernet interface
* IP Address – An IP address for this controller on this VLAN
* Netmask – Network mask for this VLAN
* IP Address of the default gateway – Wired IP router for this VLAN
* Set the Override Default DHCP server flag to off
* Leave the DHCP server IP address and the DHCP relay Pass-Through to default

Click *OK* to add the VLAN.

[float]
AAA Authentication Server 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence RADIUS server for use. Under *Configuration -> Security -> Radius*, select *Add*.

* Give the RADIUS Profile a name
* Write a description of the profile
* Give the RADIUS IP, RADIUS Secret and the RADIUS authentication port
* Select Colon for the MAC address delimiter
* Select MAC Address as the password type

Click *OK* to add the RADIUS profile.

[float]
AAA Accounting Server 
+++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence RADIUS server for use. Under *Configuration -> Security -> Radius*, select *Add*.

* Give the RADIUS Profile a name
* Write a description of the profile
* Give the RADIUS IP, RADIUS Secret and the RADIUS accounting port
* Select Colon for the MAC address delimiter
* Select MAC Address as the password type

Click *OK* to add the RADIUS accounting profile.

[float]
AAA Profiles – Open SSID
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we create our wireless security profiles for use. 
Under *Configuration -> Security -> Profile*, select *Add*.

* Give the security profile a name
* Select Clear as the L2 Modes Allowed
* Leave Data Encrypt empty
* Disable the Captive Portal
* Enable the Mac Filtering

Click *OK* to save the profile.

MAC Filtering
+++++++++++++

When using the OpenSSID, you need to activate the mac filtering. 
Under *Configuration -> Mac Filtering*:

* Set ACL Environment State to Permit list enabled
* Select your RADIUS profile

[float]
AAA Profiles – Secure SSID
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we create our wireless security profiles for use. 
Under *Configuration -> Security -> Profile*, select *Add*.

* Give the security profile a name
* Select WPA2 as the L2 Modes Allowed
* Select CCMP-AES for Data Encrypt
* Select your PacketFence RADIUS Authentication Profile
* Disable the Captive Portal
* Enable the 802.1X network initiation
* Leave the Mac Filtering to off

Click *OK* to save the profile.

[float]
WLAN SSIDs
++++++++++

Here, we create our SSID and tie it to a security profile. 
Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> ESS*, select *Add*.

* Give the ESS profile a name, and enable it
* Write an SSID name
* Select your security profile name previously created
* Select your PacketFence RADIUS Accounting Profile (if you want to do accounting)
* Enable the SSID Broadcast
* Make the new AP to join the ESS
* Set the tunnel interface type to RADIUS and Configured VLAN
* Select the registration VLAN for the VLAN Name

Click *OK* to create the SSID. Repeat those steps for the open and secure SSID by choosing the right security profile.

[float]
WLAN SSIDs – Adding to access point
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we tie our SSIDs to access points. 
Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> ESS*, select the SSID you want to add to your aps. Then, select the *ESS-AP Table*, and click *Add*.

* Select the AP ID from the drop down list
* Click *OK* to associate the SSID with this AP

[float]
Roles (Per-User Firewall)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles (per-user firwall rules) for the Meru hardware.  To add firewall rules, go in *Configuration -> QoS System Settings -> QoS and Firewall Rules*.  When you add a rule, you have to pay attention to two things:

* The rule is applied to the controller physical interface right away, so make sure you are not too wide on your ACL to lock you out!
* The rules are grouped using the Firewall Filter ID (We will use this ID for the roles)

So, since the matching is done using the Firewall Filter ID configuration field, your roles line in switches.conf would look like :

   roles=Guests=1;Staff=2

NOTE: You need to have the *Per-User Firewall* license in order to benefit this feature.

Motorola
~~~~~~~~

In order to have the Motorola RFS controller working with PacketFence, you
need to define two Wireless LANs definition, one for the "public" network,
and one for the "secure" network.

WiNG (Firmware >= 5.0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[float]
AAA Policy (RADIUS server)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, we need to build the AAA Policy. Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> AAA Policy*, click on the *Add* button at the bottom right. Configure the RADIUS profile like the following:

* Host: Choose IP Address in the drop down, and put the RADIUS server (PF) IP
* Insert a RADIUS secret passphrase
* Select "Through Wireless Controller" Request Mode

CAUTION: Since we are using RADIUS Dynamic Authorization, we need to enable the RADIUS accounting. Under the RADIUS accounting tab, click the Add button at the bottom right, and insert the proper values.

[float]
Open SSID
+++++++++

Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> Wireless LANs*, click on the *Add* button at the bottom right. Under Basic Configuration:

* Profile Name : Give a convenient name
* SSID: This is the ESSID name
* Ensure that the WLAN Status is set to enable
* Select Single VLAN as VLAN assignment technique
* Ensure that "Allow RADIUS Override" is selected

.Security configuration:
* Select MAC as authentication type
* Select your AAA Policy previously created
* Ensure that you selected Open as the Encryption

.Accounting configuration:
* Make sure you select "Enable RADIUS Accounting"
* Select the previously configured AAA Policy

.Advanced configuration:
* Make sure you select RADIUS Dynamic Authorization

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> Wireless LANs*, click on the *Add* button at the bottom right. Under Basic Configuration:

* Profile Name : Give a convenient name
* SSID: This is the ESSID name
* Ensure that the WLAN Status is set to enable
* Select Single VLAN as VLAN assignment technique
* Ensure that "Allow RADIUS Override" is selected

.Security configuration:
* Select EAP as authentication type
* Select your AAA Policy previously created
* Ensure that you selected WPA/WPA2-TKIP as the Encryption
* Unselect everything under Fast Roaming (Disable caching)

.Accounting configuration:
* Make sure you select "Enable RADIUS Accounting"
* Select the previously configured AAA Policy

.Advanced configuration:
* Make sure you select RADIUS Dynamic Authorization

[float]
Profile (WLAN Mapping)
++++++++++++++++++++++

You have multiple options here. Either, you create a general AP profile, and you assign it to your Aps, or you modify the AP device configuration to map the WLAN to the radio interfaces. For the purpose of this document, we will modify the general profile. Under *Profiles -> default-apXXX* (where XXX is your AP model), in *Interface -> Radios*, edit the existing radios settings. Go to the *WLAN Mapping* tab, select the two SSIDs and click on the *<<* button.

[float]
Profile (Management)
++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we can configure our SNMP community strings. Located in *Configuration -> Management -> Management Policy*. Again, you can modify the default one, or you can create a brand new Policy.

[float]
VLANs
+++++

You need to ensure that the uplink interface of the controller is configured as a trunk, and that all the necessary VLANs are created on the device. This is configured under *Device -> rfsXXXX-MAC* (where XXXX is your controller series, and MAC is the latest 3 octets of its mac address). Edit the device configuration, and go to *Interface -> Ethernet Ports*. Ensure that the up1 interface is set as trunk, with all the allowed VLANs. Next, create the VLAN under *Interface -> Virtual Interfaces*.

[float]
Roles (Per-User Firewall)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles for the Motorola hardware using WiNGS 5.x.  To add roles, go in *Configuration -> Security -> Wireless Client Roles*.  First create a global policy that
will contain your roles.  Next, create your Roles by clicking on the *Add* button on the bottom right.  It is important to configure the Group Configuration line properly by setting the string
name that we will use in the RADIUS packet.  For exemple, for a Guests Role, you can put *Group Configuration Exact Guests*, and for a Staff Roles, you can put *Group Configuration Exact Staff*. 
In the roles configuration in switches.conf, you would have something like :

   roles=CategoryGuests=Guests;CategoryStaff=Staff

Finally, don't forget to configure the appropriate firewall rules for your Roles!  Make sure also to commit the configuration upon your changes.

NOTE: You need to have an *Advanced Security* license to enable the Per-User Firewall feature.

WIPS
++++

In order to enable the WIPS functionality on the Motorola, you need to follow this procedure.  The steps have been done using the CLI.

First, Create a wips-policy:

   wips-policy Rogue-AP
   history-throttle-duration 86400
   event ap-anomaly airjack
   event ap-anomaly null-probe-response
   event ap-anomaly asleap
   event ap-anomaly ad-hoc-violation
   event ap-anomaly ap-ssid-broadcast-in-beacon
   event ap-anomaly impersonation-attack
   ap-detection

Next, create an event policy:

   event-system-policy PF-WIDS
   event wips wips-event syslog off snmp on forward-to-switch off email off

Next, create or adjust your management policy to configure the SNMP traps.  Here is an example policy, please note the two last lines:

   management-policy default
   no http server
   https server
   ssh
   user admin password 1 e4c93663e3356787d451312eeb8d4704ef09f2331a20133764c3dc3121f13a5b role superuser access all
   user operator password 1 7c9b1fbb2ed7d5bb50dba0b563eac722b0676b45fed726d3e4e563b0c87d236d role monitor access all
   no snmp-server manager v3
   snmp-server community public ro
   snmp-server community private rw
   snmp-server user snmpoperator v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 operator
   snmp-server user snmptrap v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 motorola
   snmp-server user snmpmanager v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 motorola
   snmp-server enable traps
   snmp-server host 10.0.0.100 v2c 162

You then need to tell your controller to use the event policy:

   rfs6000 5C-0E-8B-17-F2-E3
   ...
   use event-system-policy PF-WIDS

Finally, you need to configure a radio interface on your AP to act as a sensor.  Here is an example configuration for a dual-radio AP650:

   ap650 00-23-68-86-EB-BC
   use profile default-ap650
   use rf-domain default
   hostname ap650-86EBBC
   country-code ca
   use wips-policy Rogue-AP
   interface radio1
   rf-mode sensor
   channel smart
   power smart
   data-rates default
   no preamble-short
   radio-share-mode off
   interface radio2
   ...

AAA Servers
+++++++++++

We need to define the RADIUS and RADIUS accounting (mandatory):

Under *Configuration -> AAA Servers*, click on the *Create New* button.  Enter the proper configuration:

* Enter a server name
* Select either RADIUS or RADIUS accounting as the type
* Use PAP as the Auth Method
* Enter the IP addres, and shared secret.
* Hit OK

Repeat the steps for the RADIUS and RADIUS accounting types.  We need 1 definition for each otherwise RADIUS dynamic authorization won't work.

[float]

++++++++++++++++

Under *Configuration -> WLAN*, click on the *Create New* button.  Enter the proper configuration:

.Open SSID
* Enter a Name/SSID
* Select *Standard Usage* as the Type
* Select *MAC Address* as the authentication type
* Select *Open* as the encryption method
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the authentication server
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the accounting server

NOTE: The Open SSID does *NOT* support dynamic VLAN assignments (Firmware 9.3.0.0.83)

.Secure SSID
* Enter a Name/SSID
* Select *Standard Usage* as the Type
* Select *WPA2* as the authentication type
* Select *AES* as the encryption method
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the authentication server
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the accounting server
* Check the *Enable Dynamic VLAN* checkbox

WIPS
++++

To enable the WIPS feature of the Ruckus in order to send SNMP traps to PacketFence, the setup is fairly simple.  

First, configure the controller to send the traps to PacketFence.  Under *Configure > System > Network Management > SNMP Trap*:

*Select "Enable SNMP Trap"
*Put the PacketFence Management IP in the Trap Server IP field

NOTE: The traps will arrive with the "public" community string

Next, you need to configure the Alarm Settings.  Under *Configure > Alarm Settings*, make sure the following are selected:

*Rogue AP Detected
*SSID-Spoofing AP Detected
*MAC-Spoofing AP Detected
*LAN Rogue AP Detected

Finally, enable the WIPS feature on the controller.  Under *Configure > WIPS > Intrusion Detection and Prevention*, make sure both box are selected, click Apply. 

Trapeze
~~~~~~~

In order to have the Trapeze controller working with PacketFence, you need to define the RADIUS configuration and the proper service profiles.

[float]
RADIUS configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

  set radius server PF address 192.168.1.5 timeout 5 retransmit 3 deadtime 0 key secret
  set server group PF-RADIUS members PF

[float]
Service Profiles
++++++++++++++++

Here we define two service profiles, one for the open SSID (PacketFence-Public)
and one for the WPA2-Enterprise SSID (PacketFence-Secure):

----
set service-profile PF-Open ssid-name PacketFence-Public
set service-profile PF-Open ssid-type clear
set service-profile PF-Open auth-fallthru last-resort
set service-profile PF-Open cipher-tkip enable
set service-profile PF-Open auth-dot1x disable
set service-profile PF-Open 11n mode-na required
set service-profile PF-Open attr vlan-name WLAN_REG

set service-profile PF-Secure ssid-name PacketFence-Secure
set service-profile PF-Secure cipher-tkip enable
set service-profile PF-Secure cipher-ccmp enable
set service-profile PF-Secure wpa-ie enable
set service-profile PF-Secure rsn-ie enable
set service-profile PF-Secure 11n mode-na required
set service-profile PF-Secure attr vlan-name Wlan

set radio-profile default service-profile PacketFence-Public
set radio-profile default service-profile PacketFence-Secure
----

[float]
AAA configuration
+++++++++++++++++

Finally, we need to tie the service profiles with the proper AAA configuration.

  set accounting dot1x ssid PacketFence-Secure ** start-stop PF-RADIUS
  set accounting mac ssid PacketFence-Public * start-stop PF-RADIUS
  set authentication mac ssid PacketFence-Public * PF-RADIUS
  set authentication dot1x ssid PacketFence-Secure ** pass-through PF-RADIUS

Xirrus
~~~~~~

Xirrus WiFi Arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xirrus Access Points can be configured to work with PacketFence quickly since Xirrus supports RADIUS assigned VLANs out of the box.

First, RADIUS server configuration. Set the RADIUS server to be PacketFence's IP: 

  radius-server  ! (global settings)
    !
    external
      primary     server 192.168.1.5
      primary     secret useStrongerSecret
      !
      accounting
        primary   server 192.168.1.5
        primary   secret useStrongerSecret
      exit
    exit
  exit

Enable SNMP Agent on the access point:

  snmp
    !
    v2
      community read-write public
      community read-only public
    exit
    !
  exit

Finally, don't forget to create the SSID you want and the proper bindings with the LAN. Open SSID should be configured to perform MAC Authentication and Secure SSID should be configured to perform 802.1X (WPA-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise).
